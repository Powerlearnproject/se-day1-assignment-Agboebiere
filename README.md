#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematically applying of engineering tools, principles, methods into creating and maintaining a high quality software system. Software engineering requires anlysis, designing, implementing, testing, deploying, maintaining and doucmentation. software engineering is essential in the technology industry because it provides a disciplined approach to building software that is robust, efficient, and meets user needs. As technology continues to advance and become more integral to our lives, the importance of software engineering in ensuring the success and reliability of software systems cannot be overstated.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
These milestones—Structured Programming, the Waterfall Model, and Agile Methodologies—represent significant advancements in software engineering. They have collectively contributed to improving software quality, manageability, and responsiveness, each building upon previous practices to address emerging challenges in software development.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
These phases—Planning, Requirements Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance form the core structure of the SDLC. They provide a systematic approach to software development, ensuring that projects are well-managed, requirements are met, and software is of high quality.
Planning: The planning phase involves defining the scope, objectives, and feasibility of the software project. It includes estimating resources, time, costs, and identifying potential risks.

Requirement Analysis: In this phase, the detailed requirements of the software are gathered and documented. This includes understanding what the stakeholders need and what the system should achieve.

Design:The design phase involves creating the architecture and detailed design of the software system based on the requirements gathered. This includes both high-level and detailed design.

Implementation: During the implementation phase, the actual code for the software is written based on the design specifications. This is where the software is developed and constructed.

Testing:The testing phase involves evaluating the software to identify and fix any defects or issues. It ensures that the software meets the requirements and is free of significant bugs.

Deployment: In the deployment phase, the software is released and made available to users. This phase involves installation, configuration, and sometimes user training.

Maintenance:The maintenance phase involves ongoing support and enhancement of the software after deployment. It includes fixing bugs, making updates, and improving functionality based on user feedback.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Aspect	               Waterfall Methodology	                                               Agile Methodology
Approach	             Linear and sequential	                                               Iterative and incremental
Flexibility	Low;       changes are difficult once a phase is completed	High;                changes are welcomed throughout development
Customer Involvement	 Limited to early and late stages	                                     Continuous, with frequent feedback and collaboration
Documentation	         Emphasized and comprehensive	                                         Less emphasis; focuses on working software
Testing	               Occurs late in the development process	                               Integrated throughout the development cycle
Project Suitability	   Well-defined, low-change projects	                                   Projects with evolving requirements and high stakeholder involvement

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPER: Roles and Responsibilities:

Code Development: Write, test, and maintain code for software applications.
Design: Contribute to the design of software systems by working on both high-level architecture and detailed design.
Debugging and Troubleshooting: Identify and resolve issues in the code. 
Collaboration: Work closely with other developers, designers, and stakeholders to understand requirements, provide input on design decisions, and ensure that software components integrate well.
Documentation: Document code, processes, and technical details to aid in future maintenance and facilitate knowledge transfer within the team.
Adherence to Standards: Follow coding standards and best practices to ensure code quality and maintainability.

QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER: Roles and Responsibilities:

Test Planning: Develop test plans, test cases, and test scripts based on software requirements and design specifications.
Testing: Execute various types of testing, including functional, regression, integration, and performance testing, to identify defects and ensure the software meets quality standards.
Bug Reporting: Document and report defects found during testing, and work with developers to reproduce, analyze, and fix these issues.
Automation: Implement and maintain automated test scripts and frameworks to improve testing efficiency and coverage.
Collaboration: Work closely with developers and other stakeholders to understand the software and ensure that testing covers all critical areas.
Continuous Improvement: Participate in process improvements to enhance testing practices and overall software quality.

PROJECT MANAGER: Roles and Responsibilities:

Project Planning: Develop detailed project plans, including timelines, milestones, resource allocation, and budgets. Define project scope and objectives.
Coordination: Manage and coordinate the activities of the software development team, ensuring that tasks are completed on time and within scope.
Stakeholder Communication: Serve as the primary point of contact for stakeholders, including clients, team members, and executives. Provide regular updates on project progress and address any concerns.
Risk Management: Identify potential risks and issues that could impact the project. Develop risk mitigation strategies and manage any issues that arise during the project.
Quality Assurance: Ensure that the project meets quality standards and that deliverables align with the defined requirements and objectives.
Resource Management: Allocate resources effectively, including team members, tools, and budget. Address any resource constraints or conflicts that arise.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
